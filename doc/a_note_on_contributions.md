### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project: How Citi Bikes Bring You a Green Life 
Team members: Xin Jin, Yanzi Shen, Rui Zhang

Summary: As we all know, the environment is worsening at a fast pace. It’s high time that we should take actions to promote green lifestyle and that’s why we release our web-based R Shiny tools. We use the R shiny interactive maps to guide people to lead a green life efficiently with Citi bike. The users can explore the nearby bike stations, gardens, recycling bins and libraries on their routes. We can also suggest the optimal route and calculate the calories burned along the way accordingly. Living green is important, and we want to empower you to do your part. Enjoy our tool and learn how to live an environmentally friendly life.

[Contribution Statement] Xin Jin researched the legacy codes and add more functionalities to the existing R Shiny product. Rui Zhang searched and organized the datasets and wrote the summary for project. Yanzi Shen modified the code for easy reproducibility，refined the ui part，and did the final check.
